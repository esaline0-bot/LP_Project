When considering whether to provide care for someone, one must consider several things:
Recognizing an issue  
Ensuring surrounding safety 
Determining the symptoms 
Finally, providing aid
In addition, one must have adequate personal protection, such as gloves, in other prevent possible transmission of diseases. 
Masks, surgical gowns, and N95s are some examples. 
Though it is not likely that the average person will have the items above on them at any given moment, if you are CPR trained, it is a good idea to carry non-latex gloves and a mask with you. 
Training for First Aid takes a lot of dedication and time. However, this trade-off is entirely worth it as it gives you the capabilities to possibly save a life.
Services like the Red Cross are great resources for getting a First Aid certificate.
Before providing First Aid, you will need to consider the consent of the patient.
Always introduce yourself and inform the patient of what aid you intend to provide. Allow them to give you their consent for further actions.
For unconscious patients, this step is unnecessary as their consent is implied.
The first step to giving aid is acknowledging that it is needed.
Pay attention to the people around you. The main things to check for are:
Consciousness
Verbal responses
Response to pain
Alertness
Before acting, always ensure that you have adequate personal protection.
Check if the patient is conscious! Look at their eyes and body movements.
Introduce yourself, ask questions loud and clear: if they do not respond, then mark off verbal response.
If they are conscious, then ask them where the pain is centered; if unconscious, pinch their shoulder to see if they react to pain.
If they are unconscious, then you can immediately label them as unalert. If they ARE conscious, ask them their name, the date, and where they are.
Depending on how they answer the previous questions, the patient can be labeled either alert, confused, or unaware
If all criteria are not met, the patient is declared unresponsive. Immediately call 911!
This is an example of a standard test for patient responsiveness.
You must test them and share the results with the paramedics when they arrive!
Learning how to stop bleeding is an essential skill everyone should have.
There are several types of bleeding that one must remember.
The important one to look out for is arterial bleeding, characterized by how it bleeds in a manner similar to heartbeats, and the vast amount of blood that leaks.
For these wounds, it’s best to call 911 before treatment and work together with the dispatcher to stop the bleeding.
Arterial bleeding is especially dangerous; if it goes untreated, one can bleed out in mere minutes.
To treat these bleedings, follow these steps.
Put on latex-free gloves, and cover the wound with a clean, sterile dressing. Do your best to apply direct pressure over the dressing.
Start a timer- if the bleeding does not stop after 5 to 10 minutes, firmly wrap bandages over the dressing while applying pressure.
Careful not to wrap the bandages too tightly to avoid cutting off circulation 
If the bleeding fails to stop after this, a tourniquet is likely needed. 
A tourniquet is a device, typically manufactured, which is intended to slow down/stop intense bleeding.
The device is to be applied 2 to 3 inches above a bleeding injury. 
Never apply a tourniquet to a joint! 
The visuals will serve as an example for proper tourniquet usage. 
You should not remove the previous bandages when applying a tourniquet. Leaving them on helps create more tension to slow the bleeding.
After application, remember to write the time, if possible, and supply it to a medical professional when they arrive. If you lack a manufactured tourniquet, a homemade one can be considered. 
However, a handmade tourniquet is not as effective as a proper tourniquet.
For impaled injuries, do NOT remove the object; stabilize it (make sure it’s not shifting around) and wrap around it. Apply direct pressure on the area AROUND the object.
Call 911 as you do this!
For amputations and avulsion (when flaps of skin, still attached, are torn loose). Control bleeding through the methods listed previously.
Do not remove the avulsed skin; bandage it carefully, along with the bleeding around. 
If possible, apply a hemostatic dressing.
Hemostatic dressing are specialized equipment made to promote the rapid coagulation of a wound, especially arterial bleeding. 
Before doing anything, call 911 as these injuries require immediate treatment!
Maintain the amputated part by:
Wrapping the part in sterilized gauze, or if not available, long clean cloth 
Put it in a waterproof container 
Put the wrapped limb in a container of ice if possible (NEVER put the limb in ice without being covered)
Hand it over to the medical professionals when they arrive
For avulsions: 
Carefully move the torn-off skin to its original position 
Cover with a sterile dressing 
Apply the techniques previously mentioned for regular bleeding
Bone and joint injuries can be harder to spot than bleeding. 
The appropriate actions are: Rest the body part, Ice pack the area for 10 to 20 minutes every 2 to 3 hours, Compress the wound by applying bandages, Elevate the injured part. 
This line of action can be remembered through the RICE allusion. 
Call 911 as soon as you can! Similarly, call for fractures too.
For fractures, look for body part deformity by comparing the suspected injury with another uninjured part. 
Then, check for open wounds, tenderness, pain, and swelling. 
If your patient is conscious, make sure to ask them! If unconscious, then use your discernment and the aforementioned tips. 
Do not move the wound, nor try to straighten the injury! Only medical professionals are equip to set the bones. 
If bleeding, control the bleeding: apply pressure on the area around the wound, NOT directly on top. 
Use a splint to keep the injury in place.
For dislocations, it’s best to immediately call 911, then consider using the previously mentioned RICE method (Though that depends on the ). 
Burns are fairly common threats to life, yet few know how to properly deal with them.
This course will go over how to deal with second and third-degree burns, as those are the most severe. In addition, chemical and electrical burns will also be covered.
Before attempting treatment, ensure that the source of the burn is no longer active. This guarantees both your patient’s and your own safety. 
You do not want to treat a patient while a fire is raging in the background. Move the patient away from any potential burn risks (such as a fire) first, then start treatment.
Thermal burns, burns categorized by degrees, range from superficial (1st degree), partial-thickness (2nd degree), and full-thickness (3rd degree). 
These describe the layer of skin the burn affects. 
If clothing is stuck to the burned skin, do NOT attempt to remove it. If not, remove clothing necessary for better access to the wound. 
Second-degree burns can be identified by large, painful blisters.
Typically accompanied by swelling and leaking fluids. 
When treating, NEVER break the blisters. Breaking them will increase the risk of infection greatly.
So long as the affected area is not over 20% of one’s skin, 911 may not be needed. If it does surpass that, then call 911 immediately. 
Though it is hard to tell what percentage of the skin the burn might affect, using this model, and you own discernment, you can calculate the estimated area of damage.
If the burn covers a large amount of skin and you fail to estimate its percentage, then it is best to call 911. 
To treat 2nd degree burns, carefully and slowly cool the wound.
Monitor cold on wound to ensure hypothermia doesn’t occur
Previously, older practices included putting cold directly on the burn. This has since been recognized as ineffective and even dangerous. 
Even a slightly cooler substance will feel incredibly cold to the patient. Therefore, ensuring the cold is not freezing and is protected from direct contact with skin is essential. 
If not, the chances of the patient developing hypothermia are massive. 
An example of a good cooling method is laying one’s burn in cool water for 10 to 20 minutes. 
After cooling, use a thin layer of burn antibacterial ointment. Then loosely cover the burns in a clean, sterile dressing.
Full-thickness burns are dry, gray in coloration, and/or charred skin. 
For 3rd degree burns, immediately loosely cover the wound with a dry, clean dressing. 
These burns should NOT be treated at home! Call 911 as soon as possible. 
Do NOT attempt to cool at home, nor should you apply ointment to the injury. 
If burns occur on one’s hands, feet, neck, face, joints, or genitals, it is best to call 911. 
Additionally, if the burns are accompanied by wheezing and difficulty breathing, call 911!
Chemical burns should be treated like a major burn: in other words, call 911!
Severe chemical burns can result in permanent tissue damage and death.
When treating these, check the surroundings for the cause of the burn. 
If the cause is found, then either move from the chemical, or remove you and your patient from the affected area. 
Keep the cause in mind so you can tell paramedics when they arrive.
To protect yourself, use gloves and goggles (if available), when treating chemical burns. 
Surface skin chemical burns can be recognized by a burning smell, difficulty breathing, peeling skin, skin discoloration, and dry skin. 
If the chemical is powdered, brush it off with your (gloved) hand. Remove any article of clothing that came in contact with the chemical to prevent further burns.
Then run water over the wound. Do this for at least 20 minutes. 
While flushing with water, call 911. 
Ingestion of chemical burns presents differently: chest pains, drooling, vomiting (espcially vomiting blood), pain when swallowing, dyspnea, and holes in the stomach and esophagus. 
Do NOT treat these by inducing vomiting!
This is a myth that can further endanger a patient. Depending on the type of chemical swallowed, doing so can cause increased burn damage. 
The best course of action until paramedics arrive is to attempt to dilute the ingested chemical with large volumes of water. 
The only true way to fully treat ingested chemicals is to call 911!
If chemicals reach one's eyes, it's essential to treat them immediately. If gone untreated, the chances of permanent eye damage increase greatly.
Symptoms of eye chemical burns are: redness, burning sensation, swelling of eyelids, pain, and blurred vision. 
To treat, tip one's head so the affected eye is tilted down. From there, wash the eye with warm water for a minimum of 20 minutes.
Call paramedics at this time or go to emergency care for an ophthalmologist. 
Moving on to electrical burns! 
It's especially important to call 911 in cases of electrocutions, regardless of how small the burn may seem. 
Electrical burns sometimes appear small. With entrance and exit wounds. Most of them look like 3rd degree burns, with pus leaking out. 
Similar to other burn instances, checking the surroundings for the case of the injury is required.
To prevent your own electrocution or further injury to the patient, ensure that the area is safe before engaging in care. 
If the source of electricity is still active, do NOT attempt care, call 911 while you search for a way to turn off the electricity (circuit breaker, fuse box, e.t.c).
In cases where the surroundings are safe, check for motion in the patient. 
If not found, check their pulse and breathing. Assuming they are breathing, cover the wound loosely in a clean, sterile dressing, similarly to 3rd degree burns.
If breathing is not found, immediately start CPR and, if you have not already done so, call 911. 
Asthma attacks occur because of highly sensitive and or inflamed airways.
An asthma attack can be triggered by physical activity, allergens, stress, excitement, or even the weather. 
Difficulties breathing, high-pitched wheezing, and gasping are all signs of an asthma attack. 
Typically, people having an attack will grab at their chest; therefore, this can also be a symptom.
People with asthma will either have an inhalation device, a breath-in, or a pill. 
Inhalers are quick-relief medicines that slow down and control asthma attacks. These are what will be used to respond to asthma attacks.
There are two types of inhalers, one with a spacer and one without a spacer.
Inhalers without spaces need a little more setup to be used properly than those without.
When dealing with asthma attacks, getting the patient sitting upright, leaning forward, is the first step. 
Loosen any restrictive clothing while encouraging them to breathe in deeply through their nose and slowly out through their mouth. 
Ask them for the location of their inhaler and help administer it if necessary. 
If their symptoms do not improve 5 to 15 minutes after the inhaler is used, call 911. 
Do not go over the prescribed dose of the medicine. 
If cyanosis, fainting (or struggles staying awake), a repeat attack, or prolonged attacks occur, call 911.  
Cyanosis is when the skin turns blue due to poor circulation. 
If cyanosis is observed, intervene immediately to ensure blood in the body part is not completely lost
Asthma attacks can have similar symptoms to anaphylaxis, also known as a severe allergic reaction. 
Anaphylaxis occurs when (in order to protect itself from allergens), the body overreacts, setting up chemical reactions that can quickly be life-threatening. 
These can be triggered by foods, medicines, latex, pollen, and others. 
The best way to counteract an allergic reaction is to use Epinephrine.
Epinephrine, or EpiPen, is an auto-injection medication that can stop severe allergic reactions. 
Epipens are different from antihistamines as the former is a quick-acting emergency treatment while the latter is a slower-acting medicine, typically used for seasonal allergies. 
It is important to understand the difference between the two when administering during a severe attack can be fatal as an antihistamine acts too slowly to serve as immediate emergency treatment. 
Severe allergic reactions can be recognized by swelling, itching, trouble breathing, wheezing, and vomiting/nausea. 
If you acknowledge that someone is experiencing anaphylaxis, then call 911, regardless of whether you can successfully give care. 
Ask the patient about past anaphylaxis events. 
In addition, people with severe allergies typically have a medical tag on their neck, wrist, or ankle describing their relevant past history and needed dosage.
Typically, people with extreme reactions will have an EPIPen with the needed dosage on it.
If no EpiPen is available, then use an inhaler or give them an antihistamine. 
Wait 5 to 10 minutes before deciding to administer an additional dosage.
If not treated, anaphylaxis can lead to vasovagal syncope.
Vasovagal syncope is when your body faints because of an overreaction to a trigger. 
Fainting can be extremely dangerous, hence why it is important to be able to recognize presyncope symptoms.
Presyncope occurs before a person faints. 
If someone is shivering, shaky, dizzy, nauseous, sweaty, visually impaired (black spots or blurred vision), pale/grey complexion, or stating that they feel faint, they are likely in presyncope. 
To prevent injuries from falling, get the person to sit or lie down. 
After, tell them to either cross their legs while contracting their leg muscles or squeeze their fists. 
Additionally, if they are able to, you can ask them to squat.
These muscle contractions are intended to elevate blood pressure and lower symptoms of fainting. 
They should not be used if you suspect a stroke or heart attack!
Tell the patient to hold these positions for 2 minutes.
If their condition does not improve or worsens, then call 911. 
If the person faints, then check and continuously monitor their breathing.
Lie them on their back and elevate their feet.
Elevating the feet of your patient improves blood flow to the brain, lessening the effects of fainting.
Check for any possible injuries, especially if they fell. 
If you see any concerning injury (such as a head wound), call 911.
Then loosen any clothing that’s too tight.
Sometimes when someone faints, they can start vomiting while unconscious. If this occurs, roll the patient into the recovery position.
Constantly check the patient’s breathing! If they stop breathing, then roll them on a flat, firm surface, and immediately start CPR. 
In this case, call 911 as soon as you can!
Seizures are also important events to be able to recognize.
Seizures occur when the brain has a disturbance in its electrical activity. 
They are categorized by; sudden, uncontrollable muscle movements and screams, loss of responsiveness, foaming or drooling from the mouth; blue or gray face and lips; loss of bladder and bowel control; and eye rolling upwards. 
While most seizures do not require professional medical care, the injuries that one gets as a result of it might!
For this reason, you must move any objects around the seizing person away.
This, along with the placement of a soft object (such as a bunched-up jacket or towel) under their head, will prevent most possible injuries from a seizure. 
Some sources debate whether or not this object can be a pillow. While a pillow can be used, it is better to put a blanket or soft cloth under a person’s head.  
If the seizure lasts for more than 5 minutes, then call 911. 
Time the seizure as soon as it starts to keep track of this. 
Similarly, if the patient has diabetes, is pregnant, has an injury causing the seizure, or has no known history of seizure (if this is their first one), call 911.
Try to check their breathing during and after the seizure.
Do NOT attempt to hold them down for any reason during a seizure.
This will only increase the risk of injury to both parties. 
If they show difficulties breathing after the seizure, call 911! 
If their breathing completely stops, perform CPR and call 911.
Monitor their breathing constantly after their seizure to keep on top of things.
If their seizure successfully passes with no dangers, then place the patient in the recovery position.
With a soft object under their head. 
Apply first aid to any bleeding injuries while waiting for them to regain alertness. 
Sleeping after a seizure is normal and can be allowed so long as their breathing is stable. 
Earlier, diabetes and pregnancy were mentioned as complicating factors for seizures.
For diabetes, this is because their condition could be the underlying cause of the seizure. In this case, the normal seizure treatment procedures will not stop it. 
It's important to understand how diabetes works for this course. 
Diabetes occurs when insulin (a hormone made by the pancreas to allow sugar to enter the body) is affected in some way.
Since insulin is essential in lowering the body’s glucose levels, any changes in its regulation will destroy the body’s natural order. 
There are two types: Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) and Hyperglycemia (high blood sugar).
Hypoglycemia occurs when there is too much insulin in the body due to insulin resistance. 
This causes the body to have low blood sugar levels. 
Meanwhile, hyperglycemia happens when there is too little insulin in the body, causing high blood sugar levels. 
Hyperglycemia is more common in the US than hypoglycemia. 
Regardless, the knowledge to treat both is greatly important.
Diabetic emergencies are harder to recognize than most others.
Paramedics have noticed that patients with this emergency often have similar characteristics to drunk individuals. 
Symptoms like a general weakness, increasing loss of consciousness, slurring words, mood swings, hunger or thirst, fruity breath, vision issues, and difficulties breathing are all common.
As mentioned earlier, this emergency often leads to fainting if not treated quickly.
To treat the patient, first get them into a resting position.
Then give them sugar! 
While it might seem counterintuitive to give a diabetic patient sugar, emergencies like these are often caused by a lack of glucose (sugar) in the body. 
In addition, the sugar you give them will not harm them, regardless of whether they have type 1 or 2 diabetes.
There are several ways to deliver sugar: the most common among paramedics being glucose tablets or gel.
However, for non-paramedics, something as simple as a sugary candy or fruit drink would work. 
While they take the sugar, ask them if they have any medication they were supposed to take. 
Aid them as much as you can, and make sure to take them through the entire process.
If their condition does not improve in 15 minutes, then call 911!
Secondly, pregnancy complications are almost always 911-worthy.
If you or someone else is having a pregnancy-related emergency and you are not sure whether to call paramedics, call 911!
It’s better to be safe than sorry.
Pregnancy emergencies typically present in severe nausea and long-term headaches, extreme abdominal pain and cramps, decline in the baby’s activity (if later in term), and vaginal bleeding.
If any of these occur, then call 911. 
Place the patient in the recovery position and help stop, or cover, any bleeding.
Pregnancy emergencies can also lead to seizures and fainting. 
Be prepared to treat the latter symptoms! 
Heat emergencies are some of the more common emergencies that one will encounter.
There are three major types: heat cramps, heat exhaustion, and heat stroke. 
Heat cramps, being the least severe of the three, are simply muscle spasms or pain caused by heat.
They typically occur in the legs or arms. 
Additionally, they can be caused by exercising in hot weather.
If left untreated, heat cramps can evolve into heat exhaustion or stroke, hence why it is important to intervene early.
To treat a heat cramp, firstly move them to a cooler environment.
Then give them a bottle of water with electrolytes. 
The electrolytes help replenish the resources the body loses through sweating.
Make sure they drink it slowly!
After, tell them to stretch or massage the cramped area. 
If the cramp persists, give them an icepack.
Be aware that full relief can take several hours! Do not panic if the cramp takes a while to subside.
Next in line is heat exhaustion!
When experiencing heat exhaustion, the affected individual will be pale/ashen, fatigued, nauseated, dizzy, aching, short of breath, and most importantly, sweaty!
Because of the heat, the patient will be extremely sweaty and clammy. Their skin will not feel hot to the touch.
Make sure to remember this!
To treat them, remove them from the heat into a cooler environment.
If they are not nauseous, give them water, or a sports beverage, to slowly drink. 
Spray water on them or give them a damp towel.
Ask them to remove excess clothing (such as jackets or hats) if still sweating. 
If their condition doesn’t improve after 30 minutes, call 911. 
Lastly, heat strokes.
Characterized by flushed, extremely hot skin; confusion, agitation, and dizziness; high body temperature (around 104°F); flu-like symptoms; and dry, or slightly wet skin.
If someone displays these symptoms, move them out of the heat and immediately call 911. 
While paramedics come, your top priority is to cool them down.
The most effective methods of cooling a patient down are repeatedly dousing/spraying them in water or covering their entire down with ice packs.
Additionally, if possible, full-body submersion in water is recommended.
This can be done in a bath or a natural body of water, so long as someone vigilantly watches the patient.
Never leave a patient experiencing heat stroke alone in a body of water! 
If the patient starts to lose consciousness at any point, check for breathing immediately!
If unresponsive and not breathing, or only gasping, then perform CPR. 
If only unconscious, then report it to the paramedics on call or when they arrive. 
Make sure to check their breathing constantly!
Do not attempt to give the patient any type of pain relief medication, as they do not treat heat emergencies.
In opposition to heat emergencies, cold-related emergencies are caused by extremely low temperatures.
There are two main types: hypothermia and frostbite.
Hypothermia ranges from mild to severe. 
Mild hypothermia is shown through vigorous (often uncontrollable) shaking, alertness, painful limbs, and the “umbles” (mumbles, stumbles, tumbles, fumbles, and grumbles).
Firstly, get them out of the cold, replace any wet clothing, and tell them to sit or lie down. 
Then get them a blanket, towel, pillow, or anything that can be used as an insulator, especially for their head.
Fully cover the person if possible.
Put heat on chest, armpits, and back, in that order, for maximum effectiveness. 
Next, give them high-calorie foods or drinks.
If no improvement after 30 minutes, then call 911.
People experiencing moderate hypothermia will stop shivering, become confused or indifferent to their surroundings, get exhausted, and show worsening “umbles.”
Their skin will be pale or blue and cold to the touch. 
For moderate hypothermia, call 911!
Remove them from the cold and lay them down flat.
Do not let them stand, walk, eat, or drink. 
Do not let them fall unconscious!
You can apply the steps previously described for mild hypothermia, excluding giving them high-calorie food or drinks.
For severe hypothermia, similarly to moderate, immediately call 911. 
Treat as moderate hypothermia while waiting for paramedics.
Constantly check their breathing.
If it stops, start CPR.
However, if the person has been submerged in cold water for over 1 hour, has fatal injuries, has ice in the mouth or throat, or has a stiff chest, do not do CPR!
People with severe hypothermia are either unresponsive or barely responsive, stiff, ice cold to the touch, breathing slowly, and dead in appearance.
Nextly, frostbite. 
Frostbite occurs when parts of the skin freeze.
The ice crystals cause damage on a cellular level. 
This damage can be permanent, so be swift when treating it!
Frostbite typically affects unprotected places like one’s nose, ear, or fingers/toes.
Frostbite is displayed through waxy skin, blisters, painful or numb parts, and swelling. 
To treat, move to patient to a warm place, remove any cold or water clothing. 
Then call 911.
Do NOT attempt to thaw unless medical care is less than 2 hours away!
It's best to thaw affected parts in a controlled environment, such as a hospital. 
If medical care is over 2 hours away, then rewarm using water. 
Place the affected part in warm water (ranging from 100-108°F).
Maintain this temperature for 20 to 40 minutes, typical range of time it takes to unthaw. 
Do NOT rub the area in any way!
If medical aid is less than 2 hours away, then do not thaw. 
Sit the patient down and do not allow them to walk.
Cover the affected areas with gauze and slightly elevate it (to reduce swelling).
Give pain medication and water if needed. 
Frostnip occurs when water freezes on the skin’s surface. 
It is often a preamble to frostbite. 
It is described as a blister-like swelling on the skin, tingling or painful skin, and ice crystals on the skin. 
Treat it by moving the person to a warm environment. 
Warm the affected area by placing it against a warm body part.
Chemical heat packs covered in cloth can also work.
Never attempt to rub the area!
Poisonings and drug overdoses are essential emergencies to know how to treat.
Poison can either be swallowed or inhaled.
When poison is swallowed, one will experience abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, and consciousness. 
It can also lead to seizures.
When treating, if the patient is conscious, then ask them what they swallowed last, how much they swallowed, and their age and weight. 
The information provided will help when calling for aid. 
Put the affected individual in the recovery position to slow down the movement of the poison in the body. 
Call the National Poison Control hotline (1-800-222-1222) and tell them the information your patient provided.
Follow their instructions from there on out!
Do NOT do additional actions (such as attempting to cause vomiting, give them food or water, or try to dilute the poison with water or milk) as instructed by Poison Control.
Frequently check for breathing. If it is absent, perform CPR!
Next, inhaled poisons. 
Categorized by symptoms of tinnitus, chest pain, nausea and vomiting, dizziness, headaches, and respiratory arrest. 
These symptoms often come and go, or worsen with inhaled poisons. 
Check if anyone else, including pets, shows similar symptoms. If so, then move all affected away from the area before treatment.
Then call 911!
Try your best to determine the substance, how long it has been inhaled, and the start time of the exposure.
Put the patient in a reclined position, with back support, for better breathing.
Check their breathing constantly: start CPR if their breathing stops.
Next drug overdoses.
Typically, overdoses are caused by opioids as they are both a rising substance in the US and incredibly potent.
Opioids were originally intended to be used as a pain reliever. However, its highly addictive nature led to it being used for recreational purposes. 
People experiencing opioid overdoses will be extremely confused and drowsy, breathing shallowly and slowly, experiencing cyanosis, and their pupils will be contracted.
If the patient is conscious and breathing, the only way to treat them is by using naloxone.
Naloxone is a medicine with the capability to rapidly reverse an opioid drug overdose.
There is a nasal spray and an auto-injector version. Both are single-use!
To use the nasal spray, lie the person flat on their back and tilt their head back. Put the spray in one nostril, then push the plunger. 
For the auto-injector, remove the device from the case.
An auto-injector can come with voice directions. Make sure to follow them!
If it does not have voice directions, then inject the device into the patient’s thigh.
The auto-injector can go through clothing if necessary, but it's advisable to roll up the pants if to its thick. 
Call 911 after!
If their condition does not improve in 2 to 3 minutes, use another dose. Stay with them until paramedics arrive! 
There are cases where the patient is alert.
Always check for responsiveness and breathing. 
If the person is only gasping, then get someone to call 911 and get a naloxone dose and an AED if available, and prepare to start CPR. 
If the patient is not breathing and you are alone, start CPR immediately!
Do it or 5 cycles before calling 911 or getting an AED and naloxone.
This order of events is the best way to maximize their chance of survival.
Continue doing CPR and administering naloxone until paramedics arrive. 
If the overdose is NOT caused by opioids, and the patient is alert, then call poison control (1-800-222-1222)!
Provide reassurance to the patient and ask them about the cause of the overdose.
Put them in the recovery position to slow down the overdose. 
If the patient is unresponsive but breathing, call 911. 
If unconscious and not breathing, start CPR immediately.
CPR, standing for cardiopulmonary resuscitation, has been mentioned numerous times throughout this website.
This is due to it being an essential skill to learn! 
Not breathing for even a few minutes can permanently damage one’s brain. 
For this reason, resetting the breathing of your patients is a top priority.
Remember, it only takes 10 minutes of not breathing for the average person to become brain-dead!
CPR for adults and children is done differently. This course will cover both!
The first thing to do is to lie the patient flat on a sturdy surface. Kneel beside them.
Never do CPR on a soft surface, such as a bed!
Remove any clothing (like jackets) that would make CPR harder.
We will start with CPR for adults!
If you can, get someone to call 911 while you start CPR.
Place the heel of one hand on the center of the patient’s chest.
Overlay your other hand on top and intertwine your fingers. 
Make sure your hands are straight! Your elbows should be locked. 
Push down hard and steadily on their sternum until the chest depresses at least 2 inches (5 cm).
Do NOT rock back and forth. Keep your body steady and aligned.
Allow the chest to fully rise again before pushing down again. 
Do the compression 30 times to the beat of the song “Stayin’ Alive” or an AED.
Your compression should be at a rate of 100 to 120 a minute if done correctly. 
Then tilt the patient’s head back.
Pinch their nose, take a deep breath, then push the breath into the patient’s mouth (preferably through a mouth-to-barrier device and not mouth-to-mouth).
Do two of these before restarting chest compression.
Then repeat 30 chest compressions and 2 breaths until either an AED is used, you tire, the patient starts to breathe again, paramedics arrive, or the scene becomes unsafe. 
If another person is available, tell them to get an AED.
An AED, or an automated external defibrillator, is a device used to reset one’s heartbeat through an electric shock. 
Adult AED pads are used for anyone over the age of 8 or those who weigh more than 55 pounds. 
It greatly increases the chances of a not-breathing patient surviving. 
Turn it on and listen to its voice commands.
If your AED does not have voice instructions, then: remove all clothing covering the chest and place the AED pads as shown.
Plug the pad wires into the AED and wait for the AED to analyze the patient’s heart rhythm.
Do NOT touch the patient during this step.   
The AED will then decide whether or not a shock is needed.
If a shock is advised, remove all points of contact with the patient, and shout that everyone nearby does the same!
Make sure your voice is loud enough for everyone to hear.
Click the shock button when everyone is off the patient.
After the shock is delivered, begin compression again.
Repeat until the aforementioned stopping conditions are met. 
There are differences in child CPR. 
In CPR, if the patient has yet to go through puberty and is not an infant, then they are a child.
If they are in puberty, you can perform adult CPR on them.
For children, the hand placement is different. 
Place only one hand at the center of their chest. Then push down about 2 inches at a rate of 100 to 120 per minute.
Do this 30 times, to the same beat as adult compressions, then give two breaths.
Use a child AED if available. If not, then use an adult AED.
Then repeat the previous steps
Continue until the stopping condition is met. 
For infants, also lay them flat on a sturdy surface, preferably one that you can stand next to. 
Place your hands on both sides of the infant’s sternum, with your thumbs in the middle.
Push straight down with both thumbs about 1.5 inches (4 cm) to the “Stayin’ Alive” beat. 
Make sure the chest rests fully before pushing down again. 
After 30 compressions, provide 2 breaths. 
Use an AED if available. 
Then repeat until stopping conditions are met. 
That marks the end of our introduction to first aid. 
While this course did cover quite a bit, it still does not compare to the extensive coverage that in-person lessons can achieve. 
For this reason, I advise everyone to seek a go learn first aid in person!`;
